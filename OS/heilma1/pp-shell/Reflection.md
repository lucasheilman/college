Doing this project I learned a lot about how programs can interact with the operating system. It is cool to me that a c program is able to change its local environment. I used these commands a lot during my work this past summer, but it was mostly using bash scripting. It was interesting to see how to tokenize elements and be able to use these parts in the variables of the functions we were calling.
