    @brief Main program for multithreaded file server
    @par Usage Requires one command line arg:  
     1.  port number to use (on this machine). 

    @par Protocol (rules for correct communication)
    @parblock
     - <em>Server initialization</em>
       -# Server starts
       -# Server starts Servers' control thread
       -# Server initializes server socket, then blocks on accept()

     - <em>Client initialization</em>
       -# Server must be running and blocking on accept()
       -# Client starts and calls connect() (perhaps within a constructor)
       -# (Server's accept generates server's client socket)
       -# Server sends welcome message to Client
          - \c ACK indicates success
          - \c NACK indicates failure, too many clients
          - \c DONE indicates client should terminate
       -# Client receives welcome message;  \n
          on success, Server allocates and records client thread 

     - <em>Service operation</em>
       -# Client sends request message to Server\n
          Supported service(s): 
          - \c MSG followed by text
       -# Server performs service, then sends response to Client
          - \c DONE indicates that Client should terminate

     - <em>Client termination</em>
       -# Client sends \c END message to Server
       -# Client ends;\n  Server performs join() on client thread, then 
          deallocates and forgets it.

     - <em>Server termination</em>
       -# Server's control thread detects EXIT condition (e.g., from stdin),
          then marks Server for termination (contin = 0)
       -# Server's control thread performs <em>Client initialization</em>
       -# Server (main thread) detects termination and performs 
          <em>Client termination</em> on every recorded Client
       -# Server's control thread performs <em>Client termination</em>; 
          Server (main thread) performs join() on Server's control thread
       -# Server ends
