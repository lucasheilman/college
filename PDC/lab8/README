With n = 1048576 trapezoids, our estimate of the integral from 0 to 3.14159 is 2

real	0m0.033s

It ran correctly.

With n = 1048576 trapezoids, our estimate of the integral from 0 to 3.14159 is 2

The user time was faster and it used more system time, meaning it used more of the system

heilma1@thing4:~/PDC/lab8/sieve$ time ./sieve 100 4
25 primes are less than or equal to 100

real	0m0.005s
user	0m0.005s
sys	0m0.000s

It looks like it take none of the system time, strange. Very small amount of run time

25 primes are less than or equal to 100

real	0m0.009s
user	0m0.000s
sys	0m0.011s

It used more system time, which in turn made the user time non-existent.
